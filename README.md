## Motovation

I wanted to create an app that could be used to build a quick team profiler. Which would work as a one stop shop to learn everything about a development team

## Installation

Installation is easy! Copy the package from my repo and in the command line enter 'npm i' in order to download the dependances. Then enter 'node index.js' to begin the app

## Challenges

I hit a few minor roadblocks with this challenge. I found it difficult to grasp the concept behind tests and how to run them. After a tutoring session and an office hours chat I found myself becoming
a bit of a wiz are making and running these tests with full comprehension of their importance.

Maping my object and creating dynamic cards was another aspect I stuggled to grasp - when I seeked help and found out that I had only missed on little line of code it was a comfort to know I was about 95% correct in how 
I thought it should be run!

## Successes

I ended up studying this assigment with a classmate and we were able to aid eachother alot during the process. It was very successful to have these catch ups and talk about our code which resulted in both of us
figuring our stuff out 95% of the time. Felt good to work with someone on different - but the same projects and help each other achieve success

With the knowledge I gained from working on this test I was also able to troubleshoot an issue for another classmate and it felt like a great success to be helpful and knowledgable
